    Hi, welcome to my first of many web pages, you will get to know me and how my mind works.
    </h2>

    <p>
     But first a break for hamburgers.  üçî   üçî  üçî
      </p>
<p>
    I was born on December 24th 2003 in Lagos, Nigeria. My first christmas was 7 hours after I was born and I spent it in the hospital.
</p>

<p>
    I grew up in lagos and recently moved here 2 days after my birthday in 2017.
</p>

<p>
    I play the viola, violin, guitar (I suck), recorder and piano / keyboard.
</p>

<p>
    I am an aspiring writer and i am currently working on my first of many books.
</p>

<p>
    I really like old music, like  old Rihanna songs (well I like all though), a lot of journey and the spotify songs to sing in the shower playlist.
</p>

<p>
    My favourite colors are GREY, PEACH and ORANGE.
</p>

<p>
    I eat too much pizza and chicken, read a lot and watch too much tv / movies (its unhealthy).
</p>

<p>
  I like this picture
